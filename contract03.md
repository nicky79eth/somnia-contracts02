# Somnia Builder Reference

Public reference repository for on-chain development on Somnia.

## Scope
This repo contains minimal smart contract examples and deployment setup used while building and experimenting on Somnia mainnet.

The goal is to keep things simple, readable, and close to real usage rather than showcasing complex demos.

## Contents
- Solidity smart contracts
- Basic Hardhat configuration
- Deployment script example

## Tech Stack
- Solidity ^0.8.20
- Hardhat
- EVM-compatible tooling

## On-chain Reference
Network: Somnia Mainnet  

Example contract:
